🐕 YAMADOGS NFT

YAMADOGS is a collection of 2,026 fully on-chain generative NFT collectibles, where 100% of the metadata and images live directly on the blockchain.

❌ No IPFS

❌ No external servers

❌ No private hosting

✅ Pure on-chain permanence

Once deployed, YAMADOGS exists as long as the blockchain exists.

🧬 Concept & Inspiration

YAMADOGS is inspired by the Yamainu, a long-lost and extinct breed of dog from history.
This collection pays tribute to forgotten companions—loyal, resilient, and timeless.

Created for dog lovers around the world, YAMADOGS blends on-chain engineering with generative art, wrapped in a bit of meme spirit 🐾

⛓️ Why Fully On-Chain?

Storing both art and metadata fully on-chain guarantees:

Immutability

Censorship resistance

Long-term survival

Zero dependency on third parties

This is NFTs the way they were meant to be: unstoppable.

🚀 Why Base Network?

Deploying a fully on-chain NFT collection on Ethereum mainnet would make minting extremely expensive—and that’s not very dog-friendly.

YAMADOGS is deployed on Base because:

⚡ Ultra-low gas fees

🛡️ Backed by a reputable ecosystem

🔗 Ethereum-aligned Layer 2

🐕 Makes on-chain NFTs accessible to ordinary collectors

Cheaper mints = more dogs adopted.

🔢 Supply

Max Supply: 2,026 NFTs

Reason: Deployed in the year 2026

No more, no less

Scarcity with meaning.

🐾 A Message to Future YAMADOG Holders

To all present and future owners of YAMADOGS:

May the spirit of the forgotten dogs guide you
in all your decision-making—
on-chain, off-chain, and in life.

Stay loyal. Stay decentralized. 🐕🔥
